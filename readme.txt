Put new dictionary archives into offline-dict folder

The .exe executable's original name is 'sdcv.exe'

Use the system environment variable 'STARDICT_DATA_DIR' to point to the offline-dict directory if this is changed.
Set the path environment variable to the location of sdcv.exe or its renamed version.
